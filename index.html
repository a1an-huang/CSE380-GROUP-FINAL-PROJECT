            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

            <p>
                This document describes a game called "Fizz Run", which is
                designed to be a simple, 2D side-scroller, puzzle game. The game
                will employ sprite-based animation, tiled backgrounds, collision
                detection, physics, AI, and side scrolling
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>

            <p>
                Fizz Run will be developed for the Windows Platform using the
                Wolfie2D game engine, which is a bare-bones engine developed by
                Richard McKenna for rapidly prototyping 2D games. WebGL will be
                used as the underlying rendering technology. BeepBox and
                Chiptone will be used for all music and sound effects
                management. Artwork and assets will be made with Piskel.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>BACK STORY</h3>

            <p>
                Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite are having a fun time exploring
                Sodaopolis when Baron Vender, the leader of the Vending Machines
                invades the city and kidnaps Fanta and Sprite to keep as
                hostages.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>

            <p>
                Coca-Cola’s task is to save his friends and defeat Baron Vender
                by going through 6 different platforming puzzles staged in the
                urban sprawl of Sodaopolis. He has to use his abilities to break
                and move blocks around to get to the end of the stage while
                avoiding obstacles set by Baron Vender.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every 2 levels you will save one of your friends, allowing for
                you to switch them in said levels to help you solve the puzzles
                in new and interesting ways.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>

            <p>
                The game will work like a side scroller, with Coca-Cola and
                friends being able to run left and right, and jump up or down
                onto platforms and other surfaces such that we may scroll up and
                down.
            </p>

            <p>
                Coca-Cola and friends will all act similarly except for their
                unique skill that can be used by the player to complete each
                puzzle. The unique skills are the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Coca-Cola:</li>
                <li>Fanta:</li>
                <li>Sprite:</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                To change characters the player has to press the “” key and they
                will be allowed to switch with no restriction.
            </p>

            <p>
                There exists multiple different types of obstacles that prevent
                the player from reaching the destination that must be maneuvered
                around:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>

            <p>The abilities of the characters affect these obstacles</p>

            <br />

            <h3>CONTROLS</h3>

            <p>
                This game will be played using both a keyboard and mouse. Once
                started, use the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>A</strong> - Move Left</li>
                <li><strong>D</strong> - Move Right</li>
                <li><strong>LEFT-ARROW</strong> - Move Left (same as A)</li>
                <li><strong>RIGHT-ARROW</strong> - Move Right (same as D)</li>
                <li><strong>SPACE</strong> - Jump</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Character Selection Buttons</strong> You can change
                    your character whenever you like when you press the
                    character selection button. It will cycle between the
                    characters as you press it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>ESC</strong> - This pauses the game and presents a
                    pop-up window to the player asking them to continue when
                    they are ready. If a game is not in progress, ESC does
                    nothing.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <h3>GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE</h3>

            <p>The GUI Elements</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Splash Screen</strong> - The splash screen GUI
                    simply presents a game logo and a Start button for the user
                    to press when they are ready to play. Upon pressing it, a
                    brief scripted sequence is played explaining a little about
                    Spike and the back story for the game. While playing the
                    message "Press ESC to Skip" should be displayed at the
                    bottom of the screen. If pressed, the game should
                    immediately start.
                </li>
                <br />
                Splash Screen - when the game first loads it should welcome the
                user in with a graphic that intrigues/attracts the user. It's
                supposed to tempt a player, getting them to want to play the
                game. Clicking on that screen should bring the user to the main
                menu.

                <li><strong>Main Menu</strong></li>
                <br />
                Main Menu - this screen should let the user start the game as
                well as go to a levels selection screen, a controls screen, and
                a help screen.
                <li><strong>Level Selection Screen</strong></li>
                <br />
                Levels Selection Screen - this screen should nicely present the
                playable levels such that the user may select one to play. Note
                that levels will have to be unlocked in the final version of the
                game. Meaning, the user will have to complete the first to play
                the second, but for the first two builds you'll want to navigate
                at will. For the final released game the user will be able to go
                to this screen to navigate to levels they've already completed
                as well as the next one up.
                <li>
                    <strong>In-Game Menu</strong> - While the game is in
                    progress, we'll always have a game menu that allows the
                    player to select from the following options:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>New Game</strong> - If a game is in
                            progress, first we'll pop up a dialog to make sure
                            the user really wants to quit the current game. If
                            we conclude the user really wants to start a game,
                            then the game state is reset and begun.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Pause Game</strong> - This button is
                            deactivated when a game is not in progress. If
                            pressed, it will produce the same effect as the ESC
                            key.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Display Controls</strong> - If pressed, the
                            game will display an info screen that includes a
                            description of all game controls.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Best Times</strong> - If pressed, the game
                            will display an info screen with the fastest times
                            for clearing the level.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>About</strong> - If pressed, the game will
                            display an info screen with information about the
                            game author.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Exit</strong> - If pressed, the game program
                            will exit.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br />
                Controls Screen - this screen should neatly explain what user
                input should be used (i.e. keyboard and mouse) to play the game.
                Help Screen - this screen should tell the backstory for the
                game, including explaining about any important characters. It
                should also specify who the game developers are and finally,
                list all of your cheat codes here. These are important for your
                development team to be able to load and then jump to gameplay
                scenarios for the purpose of testing. The graders will also need
                these as well. Think of all the cheat codes you'll need in order
                to test gameplay components without first having to traverse
                entire levels. In-Game Screen - must have a means for
                pausing/unpausing the game as well as whatever in-game controls
                are necessary.

                <li>
                    <strong>In-Game GUI</strong> - Once a game starts, a
                    5-4-3-2-1-Begin sequence is counted down and displayed for
                    the player to see. At Begin, the changing room door opens
                    and Spike pops out in his Red protective suit. Balloons will
                    begin to be deployed about the chamber. While playing the
                    following will be displayed at all times:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Time Remaining</li>
                        <li>Popped Red Balloons/Red Balloons Remaining</li>
                        <li>Popped Green Balloons/Green Balloons Remaining</li>
                        <li>Popped Blue Balloons/Blue Balloons Remaining</li>
                    </ul>
                    In addition, three buttons will be be part of the in-game
                    GUI, meaning overlayed on top of the game world. These are
                    buttons for selecting Red, Green, and Blue suits. These
                    buttons will only be selectable when Spike is standing in
                    front of the changing room door. If Spike is in front of the
                    door and the player clicks on a suit colored differently
                    than the one Spike is currently wearing, then the door will
                    slide open, Spike will disappear inside momentarily, the
                    door will then slide closed, and then will slide open again,
                    with Spike popping out in his new suit.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <h3>ARTWORK</h3>

            <p>
                All artwork in the game will be original. The following needs to
                be created:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite</strong> - Each soda
                    will require animations for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Walking Right</li>
                        <li>Walking Left</li>
                        <li>Jumping Right</li>
                        <li>Jumping Left</li>
                        <li>Jumping Up</li>
                        <li>Taking Damage</li>
                        <li>Dying</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    <strong>Obstacles</strong> - Simple sprites, each require
                    animations for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>r</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br />

                <li>
                    <strong>Ceiling, Floor, & Wall Tiles</strong> - The test
                    chamber will have multiple floors and platforms to jump onto
                    and off of. We'll use simple tiles for all
                    walkable/collidable surfaces. These tiles will have to
                    clearly define where the walkable surface is. We'll use
                    straight, dark grey, slightly grooved walking surfaces.
                </li>
                <br />

                <li>
                    <strong>Chamber Background Tiles</strong> - For
                    non-collidable tiles that will go in the background of the
                    chamber, we'll just use a black and white tile set arranged
                    in some pattern.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <h3>SOUND EFFECTS</h3>

            <p>
                All sound effects will be original. Sounds must be made to
                coincide with each of the following events:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Walking</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Landing on a Platform</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Balloon Popping</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Acid Absorbed by Suit</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Acid Penetrating Suit</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Spike Dying</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Time Running Out</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Spike Celebrating Clearing a Level</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <h3>MUSIC</h3>

            <p>
                Each of the 6 levels will have their own accompanying music
                track to differentiate them from each other.
            </p>
            <br />
